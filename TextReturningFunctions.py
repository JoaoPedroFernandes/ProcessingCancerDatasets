#'''        NOTE: The "Mutated Gene + Cancer Subtype + Probability" option filters the 
#                  mutations dataset to a low number of genes.
#                  Those are considered the genes to work which would be further used to 
#                  perform data reduction actions.
#              In order to use some other utilities of the program, it is required to
#                  perform this menu action 3 - List of Genes To Work - right after this
#                  menu action 1. This will  generate a csv file with the name of the
#                  genes to work with.
